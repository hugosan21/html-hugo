      <h1 >History</h1>
     
      <p  >Resident Evil Village takes place three years after the events of Resident Evil 7. 
         Ethan Winters returns as the protagonist. Ethan has been living with his wife Mia and his newborn daughter Rosemary (Rose). Thanks to BSAA agent Chris Redfield, Mia was forgiven for her terrorist past in The Connections, on the condition that she and her family would be permanently watched. 
         When Chris Redfield and his men suddenly appear, they murder Mia in cold blood, and kidnap Ethan and little Rose. </p>
      <p>They both end up in a mysterious European town located in Transylvania, Romania, given the currency used and the names of the characters. 
           Ethan has to go through the village to rescue Rose. The village is ruled by four different mutant lords, each of whom controls their own forces from strongholds within the village. 
           Lady Alcina Dimitrescu, an extremely tall vampire-like aristocrat, resides with her three daughters at Dimitrescu Castle. 
           Karl Heisenberg, who can manipulate magnetic fields, leads a group of werewolf-like creatures in a contemporary factory called Lycanthropes.</p>
      <p>The grotesque Salvatore Moreau operates from a reservoir in the vicinity of the village and describes himself as a "newt". Donna Beneviento, who induces hallucinations, rules from her mansion, House Beneviento, and controls a puppet named Angie. 
             All the houses respond to a supreme leading figure called Mother Miranda, the ruler of the village who is a "presence adored by the villagers."</p>

      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Protagonist's story and villains</h2>
      <p>With the exception of a few facts, Ethan's past remains a mystery. It is known that he was born in 1984 and lived in Los Angeles working as a systems engineer. At some point in his adult life, Ethan met Mia. </p>
      <p>. The two married in 2011 and moved to Texas, where they lived happily. 
        However, Ethan was unaware that his wife worked for The Connections - a company specializing in creating biological weapons.</p>
        <p>october 10,2014,Mia informed Ethan </p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Dulvey Incident (Resident Evil 7)</h2>   
        <p>On July 18, 2017, almost three years after Mia's disappearance, Ethan receives an email from his wife saying she was on a farm in Dulvey, Louisiana. Without questioning the veracity of the information, Ethan travels Dulvey the next day and enters the farm. 
          There, he finds Mia. Apparently, she had been a prisoner all this time. Even stranger, she claims she didn't send the mail. Despite the confusion, the couple decide to escape.</p>
        <p>However, in what looks like a fit of insanity, Mia attacks Ethan. Reluctantly, he is forced to defend himself and subdue his wife in order to survive. Unfortunately for Ethan, his nightmare had only begun. 
          After defeating Mia, Jack Baker appears and knocks him out.</p> 
        <p>Soon after, Ethan wakes up in the dining room with the Baker family — Jack, the father; Marguerite, the mother; Lucas, the son; and an old woman - while he enjoys a feast of human remains. 
          After refusing to participate, Jack sticks a knife in his mouth to force him to eat. However, Ethan is saved when the police knock on the door. While the family is distracted, Ethan manages to escape his bonds and runs into a police officer. 
          He orders her to meet in the farm garage. Unfortunately, Jack murders the officer. 
          Then Ethan is forced to fight Jack and manages to kill him ... or so it seems.</p>
        <p>Guided by Zoe - the Bakers 'daughter, who reveals that both her family and Mia were contaminated by a 
          fungus - Ethan explores the Bakers' estate in search of the items needed to develop a serum to cure the infected. 
          In search of him, Ethan is forced to confront a revived Jack, Marguerite, and Lucas's traps.</p>
